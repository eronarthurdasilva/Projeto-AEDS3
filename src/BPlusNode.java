/**
 * Represents a node in a B+ tree data structure.
 * 
 * <p>The B+ tree is a self-balancing tree data structure that maintains sorted data 
 * and allows for efficient insertion, deletion, and search operations. This class 
 * serves as the building block for the B+ tree, encapsulating the properties and 
 * behaviors of a single node.</p>
 * 
 * <p>Each node in the B+ tree can either be an internal node or a leaf node. Internal 
 * nodes store keys and pointers to child nodes, while leaf nodes store keys and 
 * associated data values.</p>
 * 
 * <p>This class is designed to be extended or used in conjunction with other classes 
 * to implement the full functionality of a B+ tree.</p>
 * 
 * <p>Note: The implementation details of this class are currently undefined and 
 * should be completed to meet the specific requirements of the B+ tree.</p>
